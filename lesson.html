      <p>Everything around us is made up of matter. Matter can be a solid, liquid, or gas.</p>
      <p>Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass. It exists mainly in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. Each state has unique properties that describe how matter behaves. Solids have a fixed shape and volume, meaning they do not change shape or size easily. This happens because the particles in solids are packed very closely together and only vibrate slightly in place. Examples of solids include ice, wood, and metal. Liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape. Instead, they take the shape of the container they are in. This is because liquid particles are close but can slide past one another, allowing liquids to flow. Water and milk are good examples of liquids. Gases have no fixed shape or volume. Their particles move quickly and freely, spreading out to fill any space available. Air and steam are common gases. Unlike solids and liquids, gases can be compressed easily. The state of matter can change when heat is added or removed. For example, ice melts to become water when heated, and water turns into steam when boiled. These changes are called melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation. Understanding these states and their properties helps us explain many natural processes and everyday phenomena. This knowledge is important in science and technology and helps us make sense of the world around us</p>
